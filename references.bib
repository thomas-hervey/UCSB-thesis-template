It is evident from this study that user satisfaction is a subjective variable, which can be influenced by several factors such as system effectiveness, user effectiveness, user effort, and user characteristics and expectations. Therefore, information retrieval evaluators should consider all these factors in obtaining user satisfaction and in using it as a criterion of system effectiveness. Previous studies have conflicting conclusions on the relationship between user satisfaction and system effectiveness; this study has substantiated these findings and supports using user satisfaction as a criterion of system effectiveness.},

abstract = {Searching for information is a ubiquitous activity, performed in a variety of contexts and supported by rapidly evolving technologies. As a process, information search often has a spatial aspect: spatial metaphors help users refer to abstract contents, and geo-referenced information grounds entities in physical space. Although information search is a major research topic in computer science, GIScience and cognitive psychology, this intrinsic spatiality has not received enough attention. This article reviews research opportunities at the crossroad of three research strands, which are (1) computational, (2) geospatial, and (3) cognitive. The articles in this special issue focus on interface design for spatio-temporal information, on the search for qualitative spatial configurations, and on a big-data analysis of the spatial relation “near”.},

In one study, respondents were faculty and students in an academic environment examining print documents from traditional text-based information retrieval systems. In the other study, respondents were occupational users of weather-related information in a multimedia environment in which sources included interpersonal communication, mass media, weather instruments, and computerized weather systems. The results of the studies, taken together, provide evidence that a finite range of criteria exists and that these criteria are applied consistently across types of information users, problem situations, and source environments. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The literature on relevance reveals how the relevance concept, especially in regard to the multidimensionality of relevance, is many faceted, and does not just refer to the various relevance criteria users may apply in the process of judging relevance of retrieved information objects. From our point of view, the multidimensionality of relevance explains why some will argue that no consensus has been reached on the relevance concept. Thus, the objective of this article is to present an overview of the many different views and ways by which the concept of relevance is used - leading to a consistent and compatible understanding of the concept. In addition, special attention is paid to the type of situational relevance. Many researchers perceive situational relevance as the most realistic type of user relevance, and therefore situational relevance is discussed with reference to its potential dynamic nature, and as a requirement for interactive information retrieval (IIR) evaluation.},

@article{Bordogna2012,
abstract = {Geographic information retrieval (GIR) is nowadays a hot research issue that involves the management of uncertainty and imprecision and the modeling of user preferences and context. Indexing the geographic content of documents implies dealing with the ambiguity, synonymy and homonymy of geographic names in texts. On the other side, the evaluation of queries specifying both content based conditions and spatial conditions on documents' contents requires representing the vagueness and context dependency of spatial conditions and the personal user's preferences. The spatial condition can be specified linguistically in the query through vague terms such as "close to the North East of Milan", whose semantic depends on the user's context and perception of distance. Further, users may want to express queries in which the content condition and the spatial condition have a distinct preference and are combined with a distinct semantics. In this paper, we propose a geographic information retrieval model and a system implementing it that represents both the uncertainty in indexing the geographic documents' content and the user's context and preferences in evaluating flexible spatial queries. It extracts the geographic content from documents' text by applying heuristic knowledge coded by bipolar rules which evaluate positive hints and negative hints for the recognition of geographic names in text. Thus, it represents the geographic content of documents by fuzzy footprints, i.e., distinct locations on the earth associated with the text with a distinct degree of significance. Finally, the system allows evaluating two types of queries flexibly combining the content based condition with the spatial condition. The spatial condition is interpreted as the soft constraint "close" on the user's perceived distance between the documents' footprint and query's footprint. For each retrieved document, two relevance scores are computed with respect to the two query conditions that are flexibly combined to generate an overall ranked list of documents. The user can choose the semantic for the combination that can be either an asymmetric "and possibly" aggregation between the mandatory content condition and the optional spatial condition, or a compensative "average" aggregation, defined as a linear combination of the two conditions; further, a relative preference between the conditions can be specified to achieve personalization and effectiveness. A prototypal geographic information retrieval system, named Geo-Finder, based on this model is described, and its evaluations are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Both offline and online evaluation metrics are adopted in measuring the performance of search engines. Offline metrics are usually based on relevance judgments of query-document pairs from assessors while online metrics exploit the user behavior data, such as clicks, collected from search engines to compare search algorithms. Although both types of IR evaluation metrics have achieved success, to what extent can they predict user satisfaction still remains under-investigated. To shed light on this research question, we meta-evaluate a series of existing online and ofiine metrics to study how well they infer actual search user satisfaction in different search scenarios. We find that both types of evaluation metrics significantly correlate with user satisfaction while they reject satisfaction from different perspectives for different search tasks. Ofiine metrics better align with user satisfaction in homogeneous search (i.e.Ten blue links) whereas online metrics outperform when vertical results are federated. Finally, we also propose to incorporate mouse hover information into existing online evaluation metrics, and empirically show that they better align with search user satisfaction than click-based online metrics.},

@article{Cole2011,
abstract = {Abstract This article proposes a theory of information need for information retrieval (IR). Information need traditionally denotes the start state for someone seeking information, which includes information search using an IR system. There are two perspectives on information need. The dominant, computer science perspective is that the user needs to find an answer to a well-defined question which is easy for the user to formulate into a query to the system. Ironically, information science's best known model of information need (Taylor, 1968) deems it to be a “black box”—unknowable and nonspecifiable by the user in a query to the information system. Information science has instead devoted itself to studying eight adjacent or surrogate concepts (information seeking, search and use; problem, problematic situation and task; sense making and evolutionary adaptation/information foraging). Based on an analysis of these eight adjacent/surrogate concepts, we create six testable propositions for a theory of information need. The central assumption of the theory is that while computer science sees IR as an information- or answer-finding system, focused on the user finding an answer, an information science or user-oriented theory of information need envisages a knowledge formulation/acquisition system.},

abstract = {Spatial prepositions such as in, on and near are important to describe where things are located in relation to other geographic features. Location-based services (LBS) usually disregard such spatial prepositions. Their automatic detec-tion and interpretation is challenging, because prepositions are quite often used in non-spatial context (e.g., " in the afternoon "). This paper analyses spatial relations in short messages. Short messages typically have special characteristics (e.g., slang, abbreviations, etc.) and thus represent a special type of natural language. A sample corpus of short messages was used to extract descriptions based on spatial prepo-sitions and to analyse their commonness of use. A frequency-based probability for each term to be spatial was calculated, which can serve as an indicator of a verbal spatial description and support the development of intelligent spatial language interpretation in automatic systems.},

abstract = {This research compares the geographic information retrieval (GIR) performance of a set of logistic regression models with those of five non-probabilistic methods that compute a spatial similarity score for a query{\^{a}}€“document pair. All methods are applied to a test collection of queries and documents indexed spatially by two convex conservative geometric approximations: the minimum bounding box (MBB) and the convex hull. In the comparison, the tested logistic regression models outperform, in terms of standard information retrieval recall and precision measures, all of the non-probabilistic methods. The retrieval performance achieved by the logistic regression models on MBB approximations is similar to that achieved by the use of the non-probabilistic methods on convex hulls. Although these results are valid only for the test collection used in this study, they suggest that a logistic regression approach to GIR provides an alternative to the use of higher-quality geometric representations that are more difficult to obtain, implement, and process. Additionally, this research demonstrates the ability of a probabilistic approach to effectively incorporate information about geographic context in the spatial ranking process.},

A common use of ontologies in Semantic Web is to enrich the current Web resources with some well-defined meaning to enhance the search capabilities of existing web searching systems. This paper reports on how ontologies developed in the EU Semantic Web project SPIRIT are used to support retrieval of documents that are considered to be spatially relevant to users' queries. The query expansion techniques presented in this paper are based on both a domain and a geographical ontology. The proposed techniques are distinguished from conventional ones in that a query is expanded by derivation of its geographical query footprint. The techniques are specially designed to resolve a query (such as castles near Edinburgh) that involves spatial terms (e.g. Edinburgh) and fuzzy spatial relationships (e.g. near) that qualify the spatial terms. Various factors are taken into account to support intelligent expansion of a spatial query, including, spatial terms as encoded in the geographical ontology, non-spatial terms as encoded in the domain ontology, as well as the semantics of the spatial relationships and their context of use. Some experiments have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed techniques using sample realistic ontologies. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

In this article we critically review both the application of measures used to identify collocability between words and the nature of the relationship between two collocates. Particular attention is paid to the comparison of collocability across different corpora representing different genres, registers, or modalities. Several issues involved in the interpretation of collocational patterns in the production of first language and second language users are also considered.

abstract = {Place-based GIS are at the forefront of GIScience research and characterized by textual descriptions, human conceptualizations as well as the spatial-semantic relationships among places. The concepts of places are difficult to handle in geographic information science and systems because of their intrinsic vagueness. They arise from the complex interaction of individuals, society, and the environment. The exact delineation of vague regions is challenging as their borders are vague and the membership within a region varies non-monotonically and as a function of context. Consequently, vague regions are difficult to handle computationally, e.g., in spatial analysis, cartography, geographic information retrieval, and GIS workflows in general. The emergence of big data brings new opportunities for us to understand the place semantics from large-scale volunteered geographic information and data streams, such as geotags, texts, activity streams, and GPS trajectories. The term "social sensing" describes such individual-level big geospatial data and the associated analysis methods. In this dissertation, I present a generalizable, data-driven framework that complements classical top-down approaches by extracting the representations of vague cognitive regions and function regions from bottom-up approaches using spatial statistics and machine learning techniques with various social sensing sources. I demonstrate how to derive crisp boundaries for cognitive and functional regions from points of interest data, and show how natural language processing techniques can enrich our understanding of places and form a foundation for the semantic characterization of place types and the generalization of regions. This work makes contributions to the development of computational methodologies for extracting vague cognitive regions and functional regions using data-driven approaches as well as the novel semantic generalization processing technique.},

We propose probability distributions for each known form of these two types of uncertainties and present a probabilistic method to georeference localities based on the integration of different uncertainty sources.},

This paper examines the assumptions in different views of relevance, including “the system's view” and “the user's view” and offers a reinterpretation of these views. The paper finds that what was regarded as the most fundamental view by Saracevic in 1975 has not since been considered (with very few exceptions). Other views, which are based on less fruitful assumptions, have dominated the discourse on relevance in information retrieval and information science. Many authors have reexamined the concept of relevance in information science, but have neglected the subject knowledge view, hence basic theoretical assumptions seem not to have been properly addressed. It is as urgent now as it was in 1975 seriously to consider “the subject knowledge view” of relevance (which may also be termed “the epistemological view”). The concept of relevance, like other basic concepts, is influenced by overall approaches to information science, such as the cognitive view and the domain-analytic view. There is today a trend toward a social paradigm for information science. This paper offers an understanding of relevance from such a social point of view.},

abstract = {Online evaluation is one of the most common approaches to measure the effectiveness of an information retrieval system. It involves fielding the information retrieval system to real users, and observing these users' interactions in-situ while they engage with the system. This allows actual users with real world information needs to play an important part in assessing retrieval quality. As such, online evaluation complements the common alternative offline evaluation approaches which may provide more easily interpretable outcomes, yet are often less realistic when measuring of quality and actual user experience. In this survey, we provide an overview of online evaluation techniques for information retrieval. We show how online evaluation is used for controlled experiments, segmenting them into experiment designs that allow absolute or relative quality assessments. Our presentation of different metrics further partitions online evaluation based on different sized experimental units commonly of interest: documents, lists and sessions. Additionally, we include an extensive discussion of recent work on data re-use, and experiment estimation based on historical data. A substantial part of this work focuses on practical issues: How to run evaluations in practice, how to select experimental parameters, how to take into account ethical considerations inherent in online evaluations, and limitations. While most published work on online experimentation today is at large scale in systems with millions of users, we also emphasize that the same techniques can be applied at small scale. To this end, we emphasize recent work that makes it easier to use at smaller scales and encourage studying real-world information seeking in a wide range of scenarios. Finally, we present a summary of the most recent work in the area, and describe open problems, as well as postulating future directions.},

abstract = {Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR) systems provide users with functionalities of representation, storage, organisation of and access to various types of electronic information resources based on their textual and geographic context. In contrast with conventional Information Retrieval (IR) systems, GIR places the main emphasis on geographic information, which can be defined as information that references some part of the Earth's surface. This thesis explores various aspects of the development, evaluation and application of GIR systems, including: 1) the extraction and grounding of geographic information entities from documents written in natural languages; 2) the geo-textual ranking of GIR retrieval results; 3) the GIR information retrieval model; and 4) the publishing, browsing and navigation of geographic information on the World Wide Web (WWW). The first study focuses upon the extraction and grounding of geographic information entities. This research investigates the nature of ambiguities in geographic information entities as well as the heuristics of disambiguation. My approach for this study consists of a hierarchical structure-based geographic relationship model that is used to describe connections between geographic information entities, and a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used to resolve ambiguities. The proposed approach has been evaluated on a toponym disambiguation task using a large collection of news articles. The second study details the development and validation of a GIR ranking mechanism. The proposed approach takes advantage of the power of the Genetic Programming (GP) paradigm with the aim of finding an optimal functional form that integrates both textual and geographic similarities between retrieved documents and a given user query. My approach has been validated by applying it to a large collection of geographic metadata documents. The performance evaluation shows that significant improvement over existing ranking methods can be achieved with appropriate GP implementations. The third study addresses the problem of modelling the GIR retrieval process that takes into account both thematic and geographic criteria. Based on the Spreading Activation Network (SAN), the proposed model consists a two-layer associative network that is used to construct a structured search space; a constrained spreading activation algorithm that is used to retrieve and to rank relevant documents; and a geographic knowledge base that is used to provide necessary domain knowledge for network. The retrieval performance of my model has been evaluated using the GeoCLEF 2006 tasks. The unswTitleBase and unswNarrBase runs archived a 32.75{\%} and 39.64{\%} improvement comparing to the mean average precision of all submitted runs in monolingual English task. The unswTitleBase run was ranked fourth with 73 entries in title and description fields only run. The fourth study discusses the publishing, browsing and navigation of geographic information on the World Wide Web. Key challenges in designing and implementing of a GIR user interface through which online content can be systematically organised based on their geospatial characteristics, and can be efficiently accessed and interrelated, are addressed. The components of the proposed system are described in detail, and the effectiveness and the usefulness of the system are shown by applying it to a large collection of geo-tagged web pages. In summary, this thesis has developed a GIR system to support the representation, retrieval and presentation of geographic information. The system is designed to allow facilities of both textual and geographic context of information to provide better performance than keyword-based searching. Experimental results and case studies have shown the potential of the approaches in various GIR application domains.},

abstract = {Place names are often used to describe and to enquire about geographical information. It is common for users to employ vernacular names that have vague spatial extent and which do not correspond to the official and administrative place name terminology recorded within typical gazetteers. There is a need therefore to enrich gazetteers with knowledge of such vague places and hence improve the quality of place name-based information retrieval. Here we describe a method for modelling vague places using knowledge harvested from web pages. It is found that vague place names are frequently accompanied in text by the names of more precise co-located places that lie within the extent of the target vague place. Density surface modelling of the frequency of co- occurrence of such names provides an effective method of representing the inherent uncertainty of the extent of the vague place while also enabling approximate crisp boundaries to be derived from contours if required. The method is evaluated using both precise and vague places. The use of the resulting approximate boundaries is demonstrated using an experimental geographical search engine.},

abstract = {Web searchers signal their geographic intent by using place‐names in search queries. They also indicate their flexibility about geographic specificity by reformulating their queries. By examining this data we can learn to understand web searcher flexibility with respect to geographic intent. We examine aggregated data of queries with locations, and locations identified from IP addresses, to identify overall distance preferences, as well as distance preferences by search topic. We also examine query rewriting: both deliberate query rewriting, conducted in web search sessions, and automated query rewriting, with manual relevance judgments of geo‐modified queries. We find geo‐specification in 12.7{\%} of user query rewrites in search sessions, and show the breakdown into sub‐classes such as same‐city, same‐state, same‐country and different‐country. We also measure the dependence between US‐state‐name and distance‐of‐modified‐location‐from‐original‐location, finding that Vermont web searchers modify their locations greater distances than California web searchers. We find that automatically‐modified queries are perceived as much more relevant when the geographic component is unchanged. We look at the relationship between the non‐location part of a query and the distance from the user. We see that people search for child day‐care near their locations and maps far from where they are located. We also give distance profiles for the top topics which cooccur with place‐names in queries, which could be used to set document priors based on document proximity and query topic.},

abstract = {To cope with the immense amount of content on the web, search engines often use complex algorithms to personalize search results for individual users. However, personalization of search results has led to worries about the Filter Bubble Effect, where the personalization algorithm decides that some useful information is irrelevant to the user, and thus prevents them from locating it. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to explore the impact of location-based personalization on Google Search results. Assessing the relationship between location and personalization is crucial, since users' geolocation can be used as a proxy for other demographic traits, like race, income, educational attainment, and political affiliation. In other words, does location-based personalization trap users in geolocal Filter Bubbles? Using our methodology, we collected 30 days of search results from Google Search in response to 240 different queries. By comparing search results gathered from 59 GPS coordinates around the US at three different granularities (county, state, and national), we are able to observe that differences in search results due to personalization grow as physical distance increases. However these differences are highly dependent on what a user searches for: queries for local establishments receive 4-5 different results per page, while more general terms exhibit essentially no personalization.},

abstract = {Academic libraries have always supported research across disciplines by integrating access to diverse contents and resources. They now have the opportunity to reinvent their role in facilitating interdiscipli-nary work by offering researchers new ways of sharing, curating, discovering, and linking research data. Spatial data and metadata support this process because location often integrates disciplinary perspectives, enabling researchers to make their own research data more discoverable, to discover data of other researchers, and to integrate data from multiple sources. The Center for Spatial Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) and the UCSB Library are undertaking joint research to better enable the discovery of research data and publications. The research addresses the ques-tion of how to spatially enable data discovery in a setting that allows for mapping and analysis in a GIS while connecting the data to publications about them. It suggests a framework for an inte-grated data discovery mechanism and shows how publications may be linked to associated data sets exposed either directly or through metadata on Esri's Open Data platform. The results demonstrate a simple form of linking data to publications through spatially refer-enced metadata and persistent identifiers. This linking adds value to research products and increases their discoverability across discipli-nary boundaries. Location plays a key role in the organization and integration of knowledge. In an interdisciplinary setting, location can reveal patterns and trends in diverse and seemingly disparate information. For example, a " geographic prism " on social mobility data in the US reveals vast regional differences that can then produce hypotheses about causes, based on local differences in factors like family structure or schools (" Mobility, measured " , The Economist 2014).

Given the pooled documents, a number of studies have proposed different prioritization methods to adjudicate documents for judgment. These methods follow different strategies to reduce the assessment effort. However, there is no clear guidance on how many relevance judgments are required for creating a reliable test collection. In this article we investigate and further develop methods to determine when to stop making relevance judgments. We propose a highly diversified set of stopping methods and provide a comprehensive analysis of the usefulness of the resulting test collections. Some of the stopping methods introduced here combine innovative estimates of recall with time series models used in Financial Trading. Experimental results on several representative collections show that some stopping methods can reduce up to 95{\%} of the assessment effort and still produce a robust test collection. We demonstrate that the reduced set of judgments can be reliably employed to compare search systems using disparate effectiveness metrics such as Average Precision, NDCG, P@100, and Rank Biased Precision. With all these measures, the correlations found between full pool rankings and reduced pool rankings is very high.},

Semantic Indexing and Ranking (SIR) ? for a semantic-enabled, more effective data discovery. In addition to its ability to handle subject-based search, we propose a mechanism to combine geospatial taxonomy and Yahoo!

The metadata set, in the format of ISO19115, from NASA's SEDAC (Socio-Economic Data Application Center) is used as the corpus of SIR. Results show that our semantic search engine SIR built on LSATTR methods outperforms existing keyword-matching techniques, such as Lucene, in terms of both recall and precision. Moreover, the semantic associations among all existing words in the corpus are discovered. These associations provide substantial support for automating the population of spatial ontologies.

Spatial footprints associated with photographs can not only describe individual place locations and spatial extents but also the relationship between places, such as hierarchy. This type of information about place may be utilized to study the way people understand their landscape, or can be incorporated into existing gazetteers for geographic information retrieval and location-based services.

abstract = {In practice, descriptive localities are often communicated using named places and spatial relationships. Uncertainty associated with such descriptions of localities is inevitable, and knowledge of such uncertainty is normally not explicit. When translating descriptive localities into spatially explicit ones, it is critical to circumscribe locations and to estimate the associated uncertainty based on a set of appropriate spatial relationships. In conventional research on qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR), spatial relationships are modeled using formal logic. Unfortunately, QSR cannot deal with the uncertainty of a position. In this paper, based on the conceptual model of spatial assertions, we introduce the uncertainty field model to represent the probability distribution of a point locality. Using probability operations, we can combine a set of assertions to position a locality. Conflicts among assertions for a single locality can be detected based on the resulting field. Since spatial relationships play an important role in the uncertainty of target objects, we investigate conceptually the uncertainty fields associated with various types of spatial relationships (for example, topological, directional and metric). In a concrete application, these uncertainty fields can be customized and used without altering the proposed framework. Keywords:},

abstract = {A commonly used strategy to improve search accuracy is through feedback techniques. Most existing work on feedback relies on positive information, and has been extensively studied in information retrieval. However, when a query topic is difficult and the results from the first-pass retrieval are very poor, it is impossible to extract enough useful terms from a few positive documents. Therefore, the positive feedback strategy is incapable to improve retrieval in this situation. Contrarily, there is a relatively large number of negative documents in the top of the result list, and it has been confirmed that negative feedback strategy is an important and useful way for adapting this scenario by several recent studies. In this paper, we consider a scenario when the search results are so poor that there are at most three relevant documents in the top twenty documents. Then, we conduct a novel study of multiple strategies for relevance feedback using both positive and negative examples from the first-pass retrieval to improve retrieval accuracy for such difficult queries. Experimental results on these TREC collections show that the proposed language model based multiple model feedback method which is generally more effective than both the baseline method and the methods using only positive or negative model. {\textcopyright} 2014 Ma, Lin.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a rapid increase in Question Answering (QA) research and products in both academic and industry. However, geographic question answering remained nearly untouched although geographic questions account for a substantial part of daily communication. Compared to general QA systems, geographic QA has its own uniqueness, one of which can be seen during the process of handling unanswerable questions. Since users typically focus on the geographic constraints when they ask questions, if the question is unanswerable based on the knowledge base used by a QA system, users should be provided with a relaxed query which takes distance decay into account during the query relaxation and rewriting process. In this work, we present a spatially explicit translational knowledge graph embedding model called TransGeo which utilizes an edge-weighted PageRank and sampling strategy to encode the distance decay into the embedding model training process. This embedding model is further applied to relax and rewrite unanswerable geographic questions. We carry out two evaluation tasks: link prediction as well as query relaxation/rewriting for an approximate answer prediction task. A geographic knowledge graph training/testing dataset, DB18, as well as an unanswerable geographic query dataset, GeoUQ, are constructed. Compared to four other baseline models, our TransGeo model shows substantial advantages in both tasks.},

abstract = {Relevance is a fundamental concept in information retrieval (IR) studies. It is however often observed that relevance as annotated by secondary assessors may not necessarily mean usefulness and satisfaction perceived by users. In this study, we confirm the difference by a laboratory study in which we collect relevance annotations by external assessors, usefulness and user satisfaction information by users, for a set of search tasks. We also find that a measure based on usefulness rather than relevance annotated has a better correlation with user satisfaction. However, we show that external assessors are capable of annotating usefulness when provided with more search context information. In addition, we also show that it is possible to generate automatically usefulness labels when some training data is available. Our findings explain why traditional system-centric evaluation metrics are not well aligned with user satisfaction and suggest that a usefulness-based evaluation method can be defined to better reflect the quality of search systems perceived by the users.},

abstract = {Geographic Information Science community is recognized that modern Geographic Information Retrieval systems should support the processing of imprecise data distributed over heterogeneous repositories. This means the search for relevant geographic results for a geographic query (Q G ) even if the data sources do not contain a result that matches exactly the user's request and then approximated results would be useful. Therefore, GIR systems should be centred at the nature and essence of spatial data (their relations and properties) taken into consideration the user's profile. Usually, semantic features are implicitly presented in different data sources. In this work, we use three heterogeneous data sources: vector data, geographic ontology, and geographic dictionaries. These repositories usually store topological relations, concepts, and descriptions of geographical objects under certain scenarios. In contrast to previous work, where these layers have been treated in an isolated way, their integration expects to be a better solution to capture the semantics of spatial objects. Thus, the use of spatial semantics and the integration of different information layers improve GIR, because adequate retrieval parameters according to the nature of spatial data, which emulate the user's requirements, can be established. In particular, we use topological relations {\{}inside, in{\}}, semantic relations {\{}hyperonimy, meronimy{\}}, and descriptions {\{}constraints, representation{\}}. An information extraction mechanism is designed for each data source, while the integration process is performed using the algorithm of ontology exploration. The ranking process is based on similarity measures, using the previously developed confusion theory. Finally, we present a case study to show some results of integrated GIR (iGIR) and compare them with Google's ones in a tabular form.},

However, differences in user and system terminologies can challenge the identification of the user's information needs, and thus the generation of relevant results.

Starting from the recognition of the ontology concepts that the search query refers to, this model exploits the qualifiers specified in the query to select information items on the basis of possibly fine-grained features. Moreover, it supports query expansion and reformulation by suggesting the exploration of semantically similar concepts, as well as of concepts related to those referred in the query through thematic relations.

abstract = {New data sources, for example in the form of geotagged image libraries and digitised archives of historical text documents, provide us with new opportunities for exploring how place is described. Using a framework derived from work in human geography and information science, we illustrate how there is more to place than names and coordinates. Through a set of case studies we explore different aspects of the seemingly trivial query ‘mountains in the Alps' addressing a range of issues including ambiguity, the use of vernacular names, ways in which concepts such as mountain are used in different locations and by different groups, approaches to automatically generating macro-maps in space and time and, finally, techniques allowing regions to be characterised and compared based on the terms used to describe them. The use of all these methods in combination allows us to come closer to a meaningful representation of place in the sense of human geography within the context of Geographic Information Science. However, our approaches focus on the naming of places and their material or perceivable properties, and there is still much work to do to properly represent place, and particularly sense of place. Nonetheless, we suggest that such approaches have considerable potential for those working in the digital humanities, and especially those concerned with contributing to a spatial turn therein.},

@article{Raiber2019,
abstract = {Document retrieval methods that utilize relevance feedback often induce a single query model from the set of feedback documents, specifically, the relevant documents. We empirically show that for a few state-of-the-art query-model induction methods, retrieval performance can be significantly improved by constructing the query model from a subset of the relevant documents rather than from all of them. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new approach for relevance-feedback-based retrieval. The approach, derived from the risk minimization framework, is based on utilizing multiple query models induced from all subsets of the given relevant documents. Empirical evaluation shows that the approach posts performance that is statistically significantly better than that of applying the standard practice of utilizing a single query model induced from the relevant documents. While the average relative improvements are small to moderate, the robustness of the approach is substantially higher than that of a variety of reference comparison methods that address various challenges in using relevance feedback. 1 INTRODUCTION Utilizing relevance feedback in ad hoc (query-based) document retrieval can substantially improve retrieval effectiveness (Carpineto and Romano 2012; Rocchio 1971; Ruthven and Lalmas 2003). Feedback, if available, is usually provided for the documents most highly ranked by initial search performed in response to the query. Information induced from the feedback documents is then used to induce a query model that serves for a second retrieval; e.g., a vector in the vector space or a language model. The constructed query model can represent the information need more effectively than a model induced only from the original (short) query. As a case in point, terms frequent in the relevant documents but not in the entire corpus are often emphasized in the query model, as they are presumably related to the information need (Ruthven and Lalmas 2003).},

@article{Raper2007,
abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper concerns the dimensions of relevance in information retrieval systems and their completeness in new retrieval contexts such as mobile search. Geography as a factor in relevance is little understood and information seeking is assumed to take place in indoor environments. Yet the rise of information seeking on the move using mobile devices implies the need to better understand the kind of situational relevance operating in this kind of context. Design/methodology/approach – The paper outlines and explores a geographic information seeking process in which geographic information needs (conditioned by needs and tasks, in context) drive the acquisition and use of geographic information objects, which in turn influence geographic behaviour in the environment. Geographic relevance is defined as “a relation between a geographic information need” (like an attention span) and “the spatio-temporal expression of the geographic information objects needed to satisfy it” (like an area of influence). Some empirical examples are given to indicate the theoretical and practical application of this work. Findings – The paper sets out definitions of geographical information needs based on cognitive and geographic criteria, and proposes four canonical cases, which might be theorised as anomalous states of geographic knowledge (ASGK). The paper argues that geographic relevance is best defined as a spatio-temporally extended relation between information need (an “attention” span) and geographic information object (a zone of “influence”), and it defines four domains of geographic relevance. Finally a model of geographic relevance is suggested in which attention and influence are modelled as map layers whose intersection can define the nature of the relation. Originality/value – Geographic relevance is a new field of research that has so far been poorly defined and little researched. This paper sets out new principles for the study of geographic information behaviour.},

@article{Schwering2009,
abstract = {Semantic similarity is central to many cognitive processes and plays an important role in the way humans process and reason about information. In particular, the retrieval of knowledge from memory hinges crucially on similarity. Likewise, information retrieval systems use similarity to detect relevant information for a given query. Current information retrieval systems apply mainly syntactic techniques to determine similarity. Although such syntactic similarity measures have performed strongly with resources containing large amounts of text, they cannot appropriately cope with syntactic and semantic heterogeneity and ambiguity, if the semantics of the terms is not explicitly available. Therefore, they are rather rigid and inflexible as they cannot adapt to the user's requirements and conceptualization of the domain. Furthermore, geographic features are distinguished via their geometric and thematic data. It is often not possible to capture the complex semantics of geographic features by a single name or a textual description. Therefore spatial data is different from text documents typically found in enterprise databases or on the Web. Retrieval of spatial information requires new, intelligent retrieval mechanisms that satisfy its specific requirements. A semantics-based solution can more easily adapt to user needs and therefore increases the flexibility and usability of spatial data and retrieval methods. This paper investigates the suitability of various approaches—originally developed to explain human similarity judgement—in the context of spatial information retrieval. We propose a new, hybrid approach for semantic similarity measurement, which can represent the complex semantics of spatial data. It allows for retrieving relevant data by determining the similarity between the query and the semantic descriptions of geographic feature types within the database. The hybrid similarity measure combines the geometric structure of conceptual spaces with the relational structure of semantic nets to one, cognitively plausible knowledge representation with an inherent similarity measure.},
annote = {Revisit the conclusion and the abstract

Interesting approach to combine geometric and network models in order to include both dimension difference and concept relations in order to improve information retrieval.

Useful for understanding improvements to semantic similarity computations.

The hybrid approach performed better at precision and recall than existing modeling methods (which are discussed and compared in section 3)

Unfortunately any of this requires annotated spatial datasets, which are uncommon.},

abstract = {In the field of Artificial Intelligence the task of spatial language understanding is a particularly complex one. Textual spatial information is frequently represented by socalled locative expressions, incorporating spatial prepositions. However, apart from the spatial domain, these prepositions can occur in a wide range of senses (e.g., temporal, manner, cause, instrument) as well as in semantically transformed senses (e.g., metaphors and metonymies). Existing practical approaches usually disregard semantic transformations or falsely classify them as spatial, although they represent the majority of cases. For the efficient extraction of locative expressions from data streams (e.g. from social media sources), a fast filter mechanism for this nonspatial information is needed. Hence, we present a classification schema to quickly and robustly disambiguate spatial from non-spatial uses of prepositions. We conduct an interannotator agreement test to highlight the feasibility and comprehensibility of our schema based on examples sourced from a large social media corpus. We further identify the most promising existing natural language processing tools in order to combine machine learning features with fixed rules.},

@article{Sutcliffe1998,
abstract = {A framework for constructing a cognitive model of users' information searching behaviour is described. The motivation for the framework is to create explanatory and predictive theories of information searching to improve the design of information retrieval (IR) systems. The framework proposes a taxonomy of components for process models of the information seeking task, information need types and knowledge sources necessary to support the task. The framework is developed into a preliminary version of a cognitive theory of information searching by the addition of strategies and correspondence rules which predict user behaviour in different task stages according to information need types, facilities provided by the IR system and knowledge held by the user. The theory is evaluated by using claims analysis based on empirical observations of users information retrieval and by a walkthrough of an IR session to investigate how well the theory can account for empirical evidence. Results show that the theory can indicate the expert strategies which should be followed in different task contexts but predictions of actual user behaviour are less accurate. The future possibilities for employing the theoretical model as a tutorial advisor for information retrieval and as an evaluation method for IR systems are reviewed. The role and potential of cognitive theories of user task-action in Information Retrieval and Human Computer Interaction are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Introduction. This paper presents a qualitative exploration of university students' experience of searching an online public access catalogue. The study investigated how students conceptualise their searching process, as well as how students understand themselves as seekers of information. Method. Following a search task, thirty-eight university students were interviewed using a qualitative, semi-structured interview design. The interviews explored students' experience of searching, conceptualised aspects of their searches, their information seeking strategies, confidence in searching, and any difficulties encountered. Analysis. The interviews were analysed using a grounded theory approach. The analysis involved iterative review and constant comparison of the transcripts, including line-byline open coding followed by a second round of focused coding. Results. The results of the project present an emergent theory that explores a set of conceptual patterns in students' searching mental model of online systems, a typology of searchers' perceptions of their information retrieval skills (i.e., their searcher self-concept), and categorisation of types of searchers. Conclusion. With increased knowledge of how students conceptualise their search process and view themselves as seekers of information, educators and information professionals can work more effectively with students to search for the literature of their disciplines. Similarly, system designers can devise interfaces that suit students' needs.

Comparing our results with those previously reported on logs of general search engines and mobile search engines, including those for geographic queries, we discover the following unique features of map search: (1) People use longer queries and modify queries more frequently in a session than in general search and mobile search; People view fewer result pages per query than in general search; (2) The popular query topics in map search are different from those in general search and mobile search; (3) The target locations in a session change within 50 kilometers for almost 80{\&}percnt; of the sessions; (4) Queries, search target locations and user locations (both at the city level) all follow the power law distribution; (5) One third of queries are issued for target locations within 50 kilometers from the user locations; (6) The distribution of a query over target locations appears to follow the geographic location of the queried entity.},

Learning to rank for information retrieval (LR4IR), which leverages supervised learning-based methods to address the problem, aims to produce a ranking model automatically for defining a proper sequential order of related documents according to the given query. The ranking model is employed to determine the relationship degree between one document and the user query, based on which a ranking of query-related documents could be produced. In this paper we proposed an improved RankGP algorithm using multi-layered multi-population genetic programming to obtain a ranking function, trained from collections of IR results with relevance judgments. In essence, the generated ranking function is consisted of a set of IR evidences (or features) and particular predefined GP operators. The proposed method is capable of generating complex functions through evolving small populations. LETOR 4.0 was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the results showed that the method is competitive with RankSVM and AdaRank.},

These differences in result presentation can significantly impact the way that users interact with search engines, and therefore affect existing methods of search evaluation. Although different evaluation metrics have been thoroughly studied in the general Web search environment, how those offline and online metrics reflect user satisfaction in the context of image search is an open question. To shed light on this, we conduct a laboratory user study that collects both explicit user satisfaction feedbacks as well as user behavior signals such as clicks. Based on the combination of both externally assessed topical relevance and image quality judgments, offline image search metrics can be better correlated with user satisfaction than merely using topical relevance. We also demonstrate that existing offline Web search metrics can be adapted to evaluate on a two-dimensional presentation for image search. With respect to online metrics, we find that those based on image click information significantly outperform offline metrics. To our knowledge, our work is the first to thoroughly establish the relationship between different measures and user satisfaction in image search.},
