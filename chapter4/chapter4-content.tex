\chapter{Previous Work} \label{ch:[chapter 4 label]}

Although small, the GIR community has produced exceptional work on interdisciplinary topics like spatial cognition, spatial language, place models, geospatial semantics and geography usage in search as well as GIR sub-topics like geospatial information needs, \gls{geoprocessing}, \gls{gazetteer} construction, location-based IR, spatial representations of data, and discovery and exploration of \gls{georeference}d data. These topics are interdependent because they each effect a step in the procedural GIR process. This research proposal leverages previous work on several of these topics including geography usage in search, spatial representations of data, and discovery and exploration of georeferenced data. These are the topics that I discuss in addition to the ones in the background section. Note that while the following work has been influential in sculpting my research question and methods for answering it, to the best of my knowledge, there has not been significant work on my topicâ€“relevance in the context of search for geospatial data. For sake of brevity, I not discuss the historical developments of these topics nor will I discuss specific research approaches. Instead, I will discuss the broad developments of each topic and the relationships between them.
